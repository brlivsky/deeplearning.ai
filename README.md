# Notes on deeplearning.ai

Welcome to the deeplearning.ai repo that I've created for all those AI enthusiasts out there. In this repo, I'll be adding short notes that I've curated from Andrew Ng's [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) on Coursera. The repo contains 5 folders corresponding to the 5 courses of the Specialization. You can consider this repo as a secondary educational resource and you're requested to use the repo for revision purpose only. 

All the credits go to Andrew Ng and team on building this amazing course. Stay motivated and keep learning :-)
